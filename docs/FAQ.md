# FAQ – FTH Digital Finance Platform

## What is the platform?

A programmable settlement backbone on XRPL with FTHUSD (institutional) and USDF (member) tokens, governed by an EVM control plane and operated on a sovereign node fleet.

## Why XRPL?

Fast finality, native IOU model, built‑in DEX, low fees, and operational maturity. Our control plane adds enterprise guardrails.

## How do you ensure solvency?

Mathematical invariant enforced by smart contracts: total supply must be ≤ total reserves. Daily PoR reconciliation with auto‑pause on failures; monthly attestations.

## Are you a bank?

No. We are an MSB‑style operator with bank partners. Not FDIC insured. Tokens are payment instruments for a whitelisted ecosystem.

## How do Membership NFTs work?

After KYC, a membership NFT is issued to the wallet. Tier (basic/pro/otc/internal) determines limits and feature access. NFTs can be revoked on sanctions or risk changes.

## How does this expand to India?

Through bank/PPI partners, UPI payouts, CKYC/AA alignment, and local node presence. XRPL is used as an enterprise settlement rail; retail crypto is out of scope.

## Do you interoperate with CBDCs?

Yes via a gateway/orchestrator model that coordinates movements on CBDC rails and XRPL. Atomicity, audit, and regulatory boundaries are core principles.

## What about security?

Issuer keys in HSM/MPC; guardian multi‑sig for pauses; role‑based nodes; zero‑trust access; full monitoring and incident runbooks.

## Can external institutions use your infra?

Yes. We plan an SLA‑backed XRPL API product plus white‑label issuer rails. Tight compliance onboarding applies.

## What’s the roadmap?

US MVP → India pilot → corridor products and CBDC gateway → institutional products and third‑party issuer hosting.
