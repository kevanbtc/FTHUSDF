# FTH Digital Finance Platform – Executive Summary

Date: 2025-11-17  
Audience: Executives, Partners, Regulators

---

## What We Built

- A production‑grade digital finance backbone on XRPL
- Three sovereign nodes with role isolation (core, treasury, member_api)
- FTHUSD (institutional) and USDF (member rail) XRPL IOUs
- An EVM control plane enforcing solvency and compliance
- Daily Proof‑of‑Reserves and monthly attestations

## Why It Matters

- Instant settlement across FTH verticals (Aviation, Energy, Real Estate, Trading, Education)
- Machine‑verifiable controls reduce operational and regulatory risk
- Sovereign infra (no public RPC dependency) → reliability, privacy, performance

## How It Stays Safe

- Mathematical guardrails: supply ≤ reserves; pause; caps; whitelists
- Separation of duties: compliance vs treasury vs guardians (multi‑sig)
- Full audit trails: on‑chain events + bank data + logs

## Where It Goes Next

- US MVP live → India pilot with bank partner (UPI payouts, AA/CKYC alignment)
- CBDC interop gateway (principle‑driven, regulator‑friendly)
- Institutional API product (paid, SLA‑backed XRPL access)

## Ask / Call to Action

- Approve India pilot partnerships and local node deployment
- Authorize external PoR attestation budget
- Green‑light Command Hub UI for treasury/compliance operations
